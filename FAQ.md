### Why convert colors?
Numworks works differently in color management, as its screen can only display **65,536** *(256/8\*256/4\*256/8)* colors compared to **16,000,000** colors for a regular screen. <br>
It is therefore necessary to make a conversion. To convert a color, you can use the function ``color()`` but you don't have to, by default the all methods does the conversions directly. <br>
**Example:** ``color(255, 255, 255) [White color] --> Return (248, 252, 248)``
